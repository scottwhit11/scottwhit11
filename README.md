I bring a wealth of expertise and a deep understanding from my 20-year career as an acupuncture clinician. My services include tutoring students who are preparing for state board and national examinations, where I share insights that have been honed through years of practice. I also specialize in creating compelling, informative content that resonates with both readers and patients, enhancing their knowledge and engagement. Additionally, I provide consulting services to business partners, offering strategies that drive exceptional success.

A Californian, born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, I hold a Master’s of Traditional Chinese Medicine (MTCM) from Five Branches Institute of Santa Cruz, earned in 2003, and a Doctorate of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (DAOM) from Five Branches University of San Jose, obtained in 2011.

Licensed to practice acupuncture and herbal medicine in California since 2004, my career has spanned diverse clinical environments, including private practice, employee roles, the California Workers' Compensation system, hospital settings, community acupuncture clinics, and home visits. This breadth of experience has given me a unique perspective on patient care and business operations within the field. Notably, I delivered nearly 30,000 acupuncture treatments during my nine years at Kaiser Permanente Redwood City Medical Center.
